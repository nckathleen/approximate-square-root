###  Find the square root

Write a program that asks the user for a positive number and then outputs the approximated square root of the number.

For **normal mode**,  use Newton's method to find the square root, with epsilon = 0.01.

**Hard mode** involves disallowing any user input that is not a positive number, giving the user an appropriate error message, and asking for another input.  It also requires printing the current guess for each iteration of the loop until the epsilon is reached, and printing out the final result - the approximate square root of the input number.
